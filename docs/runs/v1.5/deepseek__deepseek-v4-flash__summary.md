## How to read this
We report ranges, not one-off scores. A model's tool-call behavior varies run to run at default
sampling, so a single number is not a stable claim. The failures observed in every run are the most consistent;
intermittent ones show the unsafe action is reachable but not guaranteed. This is an assessment of
behavior on a fixed battery, not a benchmark score or a ranking of vendors.
