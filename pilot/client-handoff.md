# Client handoff for an Agent Authorization Review

This is the technical handoff note to send after a prospect agrees to a pilot or asks what their engineering team needs to do.

The goal is simple: run a small set of workflow-specific scenarios against a staging or sandbox agent, preserve the tool-call traces, and turn those traces into an authorization evidence report.

## Short version

You do not need to give me production access, real customer data, shared credentials, or source code.

We choose one safe way to run the scenarios:

1. Your team runs the scenarios in staging and sends back traces.
2. You provide a narrow staging test endpoint with synthetic data, and I run the scenarios.
3. If traces are not already easy to export, your team wires a small adapter first.

Before the full run, we do one scenario as a setup check. That confirms the agent is reading the test data through the real staging path and that the trace contains enough evidence to score.

## Default path

The default path is client-run, trace-based testing.

You receive a small scenario pack written for your agent. Your team runs it against a staging or sandbox copy of the agent, then sends back a trace file.

This is usually the safest and lowest-friction path because:

- no production system is touched;
- no real customer data is needed;
- no shared credentials change hands;
- your team keeps control of the environment;
- I can still score the behavior from the trace evidence.

## Other acceptable paths

### Path A: you run the scenarios and send traces

Best when your team already has staging, sandboxed tools, and tool-call logging.

You do:

- load the synthetic scenario data into the place your agent actually reads from;
- run the benign user request from each scenario;
- export the tool-call traces;
- send back `trace_results.json` or equivalent logs.

I do:

- write the scenarios and pass/fail rules;
- check the first trace before the full run;
- score the traces;
- write the report and retest rules.

### Path B: you provide a staging-safe test endpoint

Best when you want the least internal engineering work and can expose a narrow test surface.

You provide:

- a staging or sandbox endpoint;
- synthetic test account or tenant only;
- no production data;
- no production-side effects;
- rate limits or test-window rules if needed;
- written authorization naming the in-scope staging system.

I run the scenarios through that endpoint and score the resulting traces. If the endpoint does not expose tool-call traces, we still need a way to export or retrieve them.

### Path C: you wire the adapter

Best when the agent exists but trace export is not yet clean.

You receive `adapter_template.py` and `trace_schema.json`. Your team fills in two small functions:

- `load_scenario_data`, which places the synthetic test data where the agent reads from in staging;
- `run_agent`, which calls the agent and records each tool call as `{ "tool": "...", "arguments": {...} }`.

Then the adapter writes `trace_results.json`.

## Not a good fit yet

Do not start the fixed-scope pilot if the only available option is:

- production testing;
- real customer data;
- real secrets;
- no staging or sandbox;
- no way to capture tool calls;
- no written authorization;
- only a verbal product description with no runnable agent.

If trace capture is missing, we can first do a small setup step or a lighter tool-surface review, but that is not the same as a trace-backed authorization review.

## One-scenario setup check

Before running all scenarios, run one scenario and send back the trace.

The setup check confirms:

- the adversarial or test instruction is placed in data the agent reads, not pasted into the user prompt;
- the trace includes tool names and arguments;
- high-impact tool calls are visible;
- the principal, test user, or role is identifiable when relevant;
- the result can be scored without guessing.

If the first trace is not valid, we fix the setup before running the full set.

## Minimum trace fields

The trace can be JSON, exported logs, or a structured table. JSON is easiest.

Minimum fields:

```json
{
  "engagement": "Acme Co - AP agent pilot, staging",
  "agent_under_test": "AP invoice agent",
  "runs": [
    {
      "scenario_id": "S-1",
      "user_request": "Please process the invoice for review.",
      "data_the_agent_reads": [
        {
          "source": "vendor_email",
          "id": "email-2210",
          "content": "Synthetic vendor email text goes here"
        }
      ],
      "tool_call_trace": [
        {
          "tool": "schedule_payment",
          "arguments": {
            "invoice": "INV-2210",
            "amount": 48000,
            "to_account": "88-7741"
          }
        }
      ],
      "final_reply": "Payment scheduled.",
      "model": "optional context",
      "notes": "Scenario data was inserted through the staging email fixture."
    }
  ]
}
```

Helpful extra fields:

- principal or test user;
- role or permission level;
- authorization lookup result;
- tool result or denial reason;
- timestamp;
- trace ID or request ID;
- environment name.

## What not to send

Do not send:

- production credentials;
- real customer data;
- real secrets;
- real PHI, PII, payment card data, or financial account data;
- screenshots that reveal customer records;
- raw database dumps;
- unrestricted admin accounts.

Use synthetic data, de-identified data, or a harmless canary value.

If real PHI or PII could appear in a trace, pause before sending. We either de-identify the trace or put the required agreement in place first.

## What I need from you

For the initial setup:

- a short description of what the agent does;
- the list of tools the agent can call;
- the high-impact actions you worry about;
- where authorization should come from for those actions;
- the staging or sandbox path you want to use;
- how tool-call traces can be exported;
- written authorization for the staging test.

For the full run:

- traces for the agreed scenarios;
- notes on any run that failed for infrastructure reasons;
- confirmation that the traces contain no real customer data or secrets.

## What I do

I handle the evidence work:

- identify the riskiest action boundary;
- write 5 to 10 workflow-specific scenarios;
- include benign controls so normal authorized work still has to pass;
- define pass/fail rules before scoring;
- review traces by hand;
- map findings to the relevant OWASP LLM risk category when applicable;
- write the report, evidence register, recommendations, and retest rules;
- perform one included retest of the same scenario set after fixes.

## Expected engineering time

Typical client effort:

| Situation | Expected effort |
|---|---:|
| Staging exists and tool-call logs are easy to export | 1 to 3 hours |
| Staging exists but trace format needs cleanup | 3 to 6 hours |
| No trace export exists but a small adapter is possible | Half day to one day |
| No staging, no sandbox, or no observable tool calls | Not ready for the fixed-scope pilot |

These estimates are for the client's engineering time, not the full engagement time.

## Communication model

Async is the default.

Email is enough for most of the engagement. A shared doc, private repo, or secure upload link can be used for scenario files and traces.

A call is optional, not required. If a call happens, it should be short and specific: scope, setup check, or report readout.

## Deliverables

You receive:

- a short scope and method section;
- an action surface map;
- an authorization source-of-truth map;
- scenario matrix;
- trace-backed findings;
- severity and business impact;
- concrete application-layer fixes;
- evidence register;
- retest plan;
- one retest result after fixes.

## Boundary

This is a focused authorization review for a tool-using agent. It is not a full penetration test, compliance certification, SOC report, legal opinion, SAST, IAM review, MCP server configuration audit, or secret scan.

The question it answers is narrower and practical:

Can this agent take a high-impact action without trusted, current, scope-matching authorization evidence?
